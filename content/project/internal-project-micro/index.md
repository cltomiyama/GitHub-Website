Imagine being able to design your baby’s microbiota. Well, recent studies indicate that it might be possible. This article discusses some factors that influence the infant’s normal microbiota. For instance, how the maternal diet can pre-program the baby’s gut flora.

Each human body has a unique microbiome, which is based on mutualistic (symbiotic) relationships between trillions of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. The microbial colonization changes according to the environment. So, the microorganisms found on your skin are totally different from the ones found on your gut. Furthermore, the skin’s microbiota is always changing, while the gut’s microbiota is mostly constant and defined at age 2-4.

As far as we know, microbial development is divided into three stages: in utero, parturition, and infancy. However, inoculation only happens in parturition and infancy as the womb is thought to be sterile (Moore & Steven, 2019). The parturition stage begins at birth when the infant has his/her first contact with the outside world. The initial exposure is crucial in shaping the early microbial population. Thus, babies delivered naturally (through the birth canal) have an improved gut microbial profile than those delivered by C-section (Nuriel-Ohayon et al., 2016). The infancy stage, on the other hand, accounts for the other exposures that configure the stable microbiota. Therefore, it is the most researched phase. In this process, breast milk is the most powerful and profuse source of microbes and antibodies (Moore & Steven, 2019).  

But why are scientists interested in manipulating the gut microbiota at an early stage? The answer is simply because the microbiota is related to one’s survival success. As well known, the normal flora is part of the first line of defence of the innate immune system. When balanced, it can effectively inhibit pathogens by creating a protective barrier or/and by producing substances that can neutralize toxins. Moreover, a study coordinated by Polkowska-Pruszynska et al. (2019) linked gut microbiome alterations with the likelihood of developing skin diseases, like rosacea and psoriatic arthritis. The research also associated high levels of Bacteroides, Clostridium, Enterobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcus in the early microbiota with increased risk for atopic diseases (Polkowska-Pruszynska et al., 2019). Consequently, an infant’s microbial ecosystems can be modulated as a means of preventing future implications.

## Maternal Diets

With so many diets that mothers can follow and so many choices of what they can eat, what can help the most with your child’s microbiota? Well, most of the microbiota development happens in the first year after the baby has been delivered, but how can the mother's diet affect the baby's microbiota during pregnancy or in utero?

In recent years, there has been a huge increase in people taking up a more plant-based diet whether that be vegetarian or fully vegan, the numbers continue to grow, but is it healthy for the baby’s microbiota? In a study, it can be seen that a mother who consumes a more animal protein-based diet which consists of more saturated fatty acids and carbohydrates had an increase in Prevotella. While a more plant-based diet which consisted of more dietary fibre and vegetable protein was more associated with high amounts of the Christensellaceae family, as well as the Ruminococcus genus and Eubacterium (García-Mantrana, et al., 2020). Now you might be wondering what all of these bacteria do. Well for the plant-based diet, Christensellaceae is a bacterium that is now just recently linked to an important role in human gut health. Christensellaceae can be found more abundantly in individuals that have a normal body mass index rather than obese individuals who have a lower amount of Christensellaceae in their gut (Waters & Ley, 2019). On the other hand, Prevotella is a bacterium that can be found in the large intestine as well as the oral cavity. This bacterium possesses a very high genetic diversity and contributes by breaking polysaccharides inside the gut (Precup & Vodnar, 2019). As you can see the study shows that there are benefits to both diets, but an important thing to note is that if you are following a vegan diet is that you are balancing your macronutrients: protein, fat and carbohydrates. This is the most important part, the women in this study had sufficient nutrients and vitamins that kept the baby healthy and able to grow some microbiota in the gut.

In mentioning this, another diet we are seeing more and more of is a diet consisting of high amounts of trans-fat and artificial sweeteners. Researchers have found that a mother’s diet consisting of ingesting higher levels of artificial sweeteners can have effects on the gut microbiota of the infant. This effect of the microbiota can also lead to an increased chance of obesity in the child further down the line (Pagliari, 2016). Another study has shown that a diet that is high in trans-fat can also have an adverse effect on the gut microbiota of the infant, which can be seen in the 4-6 week age category of the child. This change in the microbiota can be seen through different kinds of microbes and these changes could possibly have adverse effects on the child after birth (Chu, et al., 2016). The main change in microbiota found in the gut microbiota was the depletion of Bacteroides (Chu, et al., 2016). This microbiota is important because they aid in breaking down complex sugars into molecules the body can absorb and use. Now, not all fat and artificial sweeteners are bad for the child’s microbiota and health. A correct amount of fats and artificial sweeteners will not affect the microbiota of the infant. Fats and artificial sweeteners only become detrimental when they are consumed in an above-average amount.

When pregnant, your diet can have an effect on the microbiota in the gut of your son or daughter, but the most important part is that you are completely nourished. The only way to have a positive effect on the microbiota is that you are meeting the required nourishment levels, no matter what the diet. You can be following a vegan, vegetarian or high protein diet as long as you are not overdosing on foods that can have adverse effects such as fats and artificial ingredients your child should have a healthy number of microbes in their gut.

## Breast Milk Influence on Infant Microbiota

Peripartum microbial development seems to be the major contributor to an infant’s microbiota, however, there is a continuation of maternal effect on an infant's microme during postpartum development. Throughout infancy, babies consume breast milk or formula. Both types of feeding contribute significantly to their microbiota differently. An article written by The New York Times states that a baby's consumption of breast milk contributes to an influx of good bacteria in their microbiome. They expand on a bacteria referred to as bifidobacteria. Bifidobacteria is a bacterium that has been isolated in the breastmilk of a mother, and found in the digestive tracts and stools of breastfed infants (Lewis et al., 2015). 

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are non-digestible sugars that function as prebiotics for bifidobacteria metabolism in the gut. The relationship of bifidobacteria to HMOs in an infant has shown a positive correlation to a reduction in inflammation, as well as an increase in gut permeability (Lewis et al., 2015). According to a study conducted in Bangladesh, higher contents of bifidobacteria in an individual’s microbiome correlate with better response to oral and parenteral vaccination in early infancy (Lewis et al., 2015). 
Like bifidobacteria, other microbes transfer to an infant through breastfeeding. A Canadian study hypothesized the entero-mammary pathway (Moossavi & Azad, 2019). This hypothesis suggests that immune cell-mediated translocation pathways carry bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mammary glands of the maternal parent (Moossavi & Azad, 2019).  When the baby feeds from the breast, the bacteria is consumed through the milk and acts as a probiotic 	

As an extension to the benefits of breastmilk vs. formula, breast milk directly consumed from the mother and not through a bottle will decrease unwanted bacterial contamination. If fed directly from the mother’s breast, the only source of external microbes to the infant will be microbes from their mother’s skin and milk. 

## So far, what can we conclude?

With the increase of metagenomic studies, research indicates that microbiota populations are heavily affected by diet and are involved in the development and prevention of various diseases. A healthy diet that is high-carbohydrate favours the Prevotella genus which can introduce high genetic diversity and the breakdown of polysaccharides inside the gut.

Whereas a poor diet that is high-fat and artificial sweeteners can lead to an increased chance of obesity in the child as they age. This raises the idea that the maternal diet could be one of the many aspects that influence the baby’s gut flora. 

Although the field of microbiome research is quickly evolving, it remains complex as there are so many factors that may influence an infant's microbiota apart from diet. This is because the start of neonatal microbiota is still one of the biggest debates amongst pediatric scientists. Today, the accepted dogma is that the womb is sterile and the microbiome is first seeded at birth. Microbes continue to be acquired during and after birth from both the mother and the community. For this reason, pediatricians turn to a baby's first 1,000 days because this impacts the infant's mental and physical well-being. The other factors that are equally as crucial to shaping a microbiome besides the mother’s diet include gestational age at birth, type of delivery, breast vs. formula feeding, weaning, use of antibiotics, etc. 
With that being said, the maternal diet is the future of a baby’s microbiome. It is always encouraged to have a healthy and balanced diet during and after pregnancy to ensure the baby’s microbiota is ideal for proper mental and physical growth.
